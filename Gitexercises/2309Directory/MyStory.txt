In a quiet village nestled between mountains, a girl named Lina discovered a hidden cave glowing with ancient symbols.
Though the elders warned her to stay away, she ventured inside, guided only by her curiosity and a flickering lantern.
Inside, she found a trapped fox spirit who had guarded the valley for centuries.
With clever riddles and fearless kindness, Lina freed the spirit and earned its eternal friendship.
From that day on, the winds whispered her name whenever courage was needed.
